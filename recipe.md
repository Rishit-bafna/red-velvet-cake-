step 1 : Preheat the oven to 350 F (180C). Grease a baking pan. Gather ingredients.
step 2 : Mix non dairy milk and vinegar together. Leave for some minutes then add oil, vanilla essence and red dye.
step 3 : In a large bowl, add all dry ingredients, combine all together then pour milk mixture into the bowl.
step4 : Mix everything together until you get a red batter. Pour batter in baking mould. Transfer on a baking tray and bake for about 60 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.
step5 : For the frosting. Beat icing sugar and butter together then add milk. Whisk until you get a white creamy texture.
step 6 : Remove cake from oven and let completely cool down. With a sharp knife, remove the head of the cake to make it flat then cut the cake into 3 layers. Keep the head aside, donâ€™t throw it away.
step 7 : Spread frosting on first layer then cover with second layer, repeat one more time. Use remaining frosting to decorate the whole cake.
step 8 : Make crumbles with the head of the cake to decorate the top. You can add berries on top. I used cherries but feel free to decorate as you wish.
step 9 : The red velvet keeps well in the refrigerator for several days.
